An interpreter might seems like a magic box until one fully understand the inner workings of the interpreter. For an engineer it might be beneficial to gain an understanding of the fundamental working of an interpreter as it a tool that is used on a daily basis. However even when we have decided to create an interpreter, we are often motivated on adding new features to the interpreter during the initial phase. As a result, testing and measuring performance are often taken the backseat. Without investing into adpotiong proper engineering principles and setting up robust engineering infrastructures, the project can become exponentially complex as we add new features to the project.

The benefits of setting up the CI is are automation of recording the results of the benchmarks, static checking, linting and running tests. This has removed the effort needed into manually run each of the actions, which allow us to focus on the interpreter constructions. However, the downside are the time spent initially on learning technologies unrelated to interpreter constructions to set up the CI and efforts on designing the engineering infrastruture. For instance, we estimated that we have spent 4 days in learning Github actions, setting up the infrastruture and testing it. Even though the CI is set up there are still some limitations for instance the PR name issuess in previosu section. Overall, setting up engineering infrastrures can help our interpreter construction process. However, it is important to first consider the tradeoff between time invested in the setting up the infrastrures and the benefit gained from it.
